    title: 'Hyde Park',
    description: 'When King Henry VIII and his court were thundering across Hyde Park in 1536 in pursuit of deer and wild boar, it would have been difficult to visualise that years later the noble art of tai chi would be peacefully performed among the trees in the early morning, and the Italianate tenor of Pavarotti would echo across the park, applauded by vast audiences. Hyde Park was created to satisfy a royal passion for hunting. But over the years it became a place where people have pursued many other pleasures.',

The park once contained lodges, a library, an ice house and two vast "temples" called the Temple of Peace and the Temple of Concord.',

Queen Victoria was born in Kensington Palace and lived there until she became queen in 1837. It was Queen Caroline, wife of George II, who in 1728 moulded the gardens to their present form by creating the Serpentine and the Long Water from the Westbourne stream. For most of the 18th century the gardens were closed to the public. They were opened gradually but only to the respectably dressed. In a long series of improvements Queen Victoria commissioned the Italian Gardens and the Albert Memorial.',

    description: 'Sitting on the Thames Embankment, and sheltered by high walls, Chelsea Physic Garden is one of the oldest and most respected botanic gardens in Europe. It is the oldest in London, and only surpassed in age, in England, by Oxford Botanic Garden. Founded in 1673 by The Worshipful Society of Apothecaries of London for its apprentices to study medicinal plants and their uses, it became one of the most important centres of botany and plant exchange in the world. Chelsea Physic Garden’s plant collection is unique in being the only botanic garden collection focused on medicinal, herbal and useful plants.',

It combines historic monuments, tranquil greenery and eclectic tales of the people buried in its beautiful landscape. Brompton is one of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ cemeteries established in the 19th century.  These large spaces were created outside central London to cope with the demands of a rapidly-growing population. In 1838 the architect Benjamin Baud won a competition to design the cemetery, and he created a neoclassical marvel of sweeping colonnades, symmetrical features and the crowning glory of a chapel rotunda.',
